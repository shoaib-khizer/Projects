-> Introduction :
    BlackJack game is basically card game which has different cards with their specific scores mentioned on them.
    i've created it having one player called user(you) and the other one is the system can say bot which is making its moves on its own
    Containers :
        this project has 5 containers in html file and each container has specific property and their respective id's.
        Container 1 is coverring the whole project front end while the 
        container 2 has the result description whatever the result is it would display there i.e Lets play,You won,You lost,Tied.
        container 3 has two div's one is for the user where user can make his moves and the secnd one is fr system called bot and making his moves automatically and on the top of them scores has been mentioned with them acocrding to their move.
        container 4 has three buttons one is hit button which is for the user each time when user has to make his move he clicks hit button second one is stand button we can say for the system when user wants to stop making his move he clicks stand button and by this system started making his moves automatically and third one is deal button also called a reset button when user clicks it it resets all the results and moves.
        container 5 has the record of wins losses and draws according to the user.Each time when the user wins it increments one time the wins record similarly when losses it increments the losses record by 1 and same for draws.

        Once the user clicks hit button and if he wants to stop making his further move he clicks stand button and after clicking stand button user wont be able to make his move like if he click hit button after clicking stand button nothing will happe because user turn has over and hit button has been disabled and similarly when user clicks deal button nothing will happe untill the system completes his moves and when system completes his moves results has been shown and then deal button has activated and hit button activated too after resetting it.
